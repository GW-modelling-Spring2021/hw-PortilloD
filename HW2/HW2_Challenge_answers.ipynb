    "Again, the Keq is closer to the lower K (K3=0.5 m/d) because the head gradient gets steeper and the energy required to move through the new K is 'dissipated'. A lower K can indicate a lower porosity and smaller area for which water/fluids can flow through. Smaller area requires a higher velocity of flow to move through it if the mass flux is to remain constant. The Keq is a weighted average of the spaitiall distributed K values, and energy dissipated is related to the square of the gradients at each cell."

This is because each cell responds to its neighboring cells. If the medium contains the same K value but has a small section in the center with a low K, then the energy required to flow through the entire medium will be directed towards this center section of low K. A Keq won't compltely represent the system now that a small part of the medium requires all the energy to push through. If the inclusive area is small enough, the Keq might neglect this low K region. If the inclusive area is large enough, then the medium may just be three layers in series and Keq will likely be equal to this inclusive layer in the center which doesn't necessarily represent the entire medium.\n",
