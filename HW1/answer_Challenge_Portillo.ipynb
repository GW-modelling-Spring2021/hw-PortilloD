    "The equivalent hydraulic conductivity takes the harmonic average for a soil column in which flow is perpendicular to the layers. Because Keq is the average value over the entire soil column, Keq is smaller to represent the flow in the slowest zone/layer. Well why does this happen? We can argue that as water flows from a higher permeable layer to a lower permeable layer, the amount of energy used to push the flow through a much tortuous flow path is greater than the energy required to flow through a highly porous material. We see the slope of the head gradient is steep in the middle and at the top while the lowest part of the graph displays a much shallower slope. These sharp changes in gradient is related to the amount of energy released which is related the relative K for each layer.\n"
